# priorityq
## An object-oriented priority queue with updatable priorities.

The priorityq package is meant to complement the heapq package included in the
python standard library. While the priorityq interface is designed for maximum
compatibility with heapq, it is an independent implementation and has slightly
different functionality. The priorityq package is free and open-source software
and is released under multiple licenses (see LICENSE for more info).
